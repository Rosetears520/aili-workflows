# Implementation Package Protocol

- Trace ID:
- Source requirement/decision/risk:
- Package goal:
- Allowed files:
- Target files/artifacts:
- Forbidden files:
- Acceptance criteria:
- Required context reads:
- WT-001 context ref: <context_id, evidence_version, freshness, mode> | N/A
- Traceability mapping:
  - source requirement/decision/risk:
  - task/package:
  - file/artifact boundary:
  - verification command or inspection:
  - expected evidence:
  - coverage status: covered | Open Question | Unverified
- Parallelism analysis:
  - shared scaffold/source-of-truth:
  - safe parallel lanes:
  - serial dependencies:
  - benefit-gated independent lanes (maximum two by default):
  - ownership boundaries:
  - join point and expected evidence:
  - blockers or no-parallel reason:
- Research-first evidence gate: required-satisfied | not-triggered | blocked
- Implementation constraints:
- Delegation plan:
- Verification command:
- Evidence return expectation: changed files/artifacts plus verification evidence for each mapped source requirement, decision, or risk; uncovered links labeled `Open Question` or `Unverified`.
- Task-end branch/worktree hygiene:
  - branch/status inspection: inspect `git status --short --branch` in the target repo and review the relevant diff.
  - dirty path classification: classify dirty paths as task-scoped, unrelated/pre-existing, generated/ignored, scratch, or unknown.
  - safe scratch cleanup: remove only safe task-owned, non-user-visible scratch artifacts created by the current task.
  - cleanup proposal: propose cleanup for remaining residue without touching unrelated dirty paths.
  - approval-gated operations: ask explicit approval before push, destructive clean/reset, branch deletion, worktree removal, OpenSpec archive, stashing unrelated changes, or deleting user-visible artifacts.
  - commit allowance: savepoint commits may be proactive only when current task/project rules explicitly allow task-scoped verified commits; otherwise ask once with the cleanup package.
- Packaging flow when user-requested:
  - target/platform:
  - pre-package tests/checks:
  - package/build command:
  - package failure classification:
  - repair/retest/repackage limit:
- Repair / retry limit:
- Stop conditions:
- Expected return format:

An A33 package references exactly one current `WT-001` context per declared repository lane. It may not copy, rebind, or reinterpret roots, keys, Git identity/state, approvals, operation class/risk, deltas, target rules, command/cwd, or containment facts. Target rules are re-read at the operation/dispatch boundary, may only narrow authority, and same-level conflicts block. Artifacts stay in the owning target repository.

Decision-shaping research that can affect scope, architecture, dependencies, public contract, permissions, acceptance, or verification strategy must be closed in DEFINE. It cannot be waived or accepted as `Unverified`; discovery during BUILD emits `BUILD_MATERIAL_DISCOVERY` and stops changed work. Named non-material runtime residuals remain under their separate fail-closed operation gates.

Direct work is the default. Task use is optional and benefit-gated, with at most two concurrent lanes by default. A package never creates automatic review, test, security, verifier, full-suite, or repair-loop lanes. Verification is the smallest fresh check that proves the exact claim.
