# AILI Delivery Flow

This is the canonical lifecycle/router authority for IDEATE, DEFINE, BUILD, and SHIP. Equivalent natural-language intent and command shortcuts enter the same state, gates, progress, stop conditions, and verification owner.

## Workflow

### Semantic router

For each current user intent, ROSE selects:

1. command intent when present, otherwise equivalent natural-language intent;
2. ordinary or formal/material handling;
3. one primary process/domain/artifact loop;
4. zero or one auxiliary capability only for a named gap the primary loop cannot cover directly;
5. one terminal outcome: `complete`, `need-user`, `need-evidence`, `material-delta`, `blocked`, or `Unverified`.

Explicit user intent wins, followed by the narrowest artifact/domain owner, then the lifecycle loop. A skill match is a route into this state, not a second workflow. Skills must not invoke another process skill, recurse, change phase, create another ledger/approval system, or automatically add planning, research, TDD, review, test, security, coverage, or convergence work.

Near misses stay direct: lifecycle words used for explanation/status, code that merely has tests, multi-file work without a planning need, and completion wording without a concrete review or evidence gap do not activate extra skills.

### Mode decision table

| User intent | Mode/loop | Required gate | Stop boundary |
|---|---|---|---|
| Explore options without implementation | IDEATE | current request and relevant evidence | options/unknowns produced or material formal trigger found |
| Create or materially revise a durable change contract | DEFINE | one resolved change identity | coherent artifacts plus final `test-plan.md` acceptance, or exact blocker |
| Explicitly implement a resolved accepted formal change | BUILD | current acceptance, target, package, permission, and claim-verification path | accepted queue implemented and smallest completion check selected, or blocker/material delta |
| Explicitly close out implemented work | SHIP | fresh SHIP intent and current implementation evidence | exact closeout claim supported or blocked |
| Bounded work with no formal/material trigger | ordinary | clear scope and local rules | requested outcome and smallest claim-matched evidence |

### Execution and approval classes

- Safe local execution: perform requested in-scope reads, edits, deterministic diagnostics, and non-destructive claim-matched checks without asking for each step.
- Material decision: ask one focused question only when the answer changes scope, architecture, public contract, dependency, permission, acceptance, verification strategy, product behavior, or target identity.
- Risky operation: obtain the existing exact approval for destructive, external access/write/directory, dependency/lockfile, schema/migration, auth/permission/secret/security, Git/release, or A33 ADD/REMOVE operations.

Every question names the decision or operation, target, why now, risk/trade-off, options, recommendation or uncertainty, and denial effect. One answer/approval never authorizes another operation, target, or risk class.

### Directed hydration

Read only evidence needed for the current mode, dependency, event, and claim:

| Entry | Required current evidence | Conditional evidence |
|---|---|---|
| new DEFINE | change identity and dependencies for the next artifact | interview/context only for a material question or term |
| DEFINE continuation | changed artifact and direct dependents | progress/drift only for resume, deviation, or conflict |
| BUILD start/resume | accepted final-test-plan gate, current tasks/package and owning contract sections, target/Git/rules, affected verification | unrelated DEFINE/history only on conflict or material discovery |
| SHIP | implemented diff/tree, current BUILD evidence, explicit target | only affected/stale risk, integration, packaging, or release evidence |
| ordinary continuation | current request and directly relevant files | formal artifacts only when formal work is resumed or changed |

Re-read every written file once before using it as durable evidence. A relevant user correction, write, hook, content/config/dependency/toolchain/target change, or conflict invalidates only dependent evidence. Phase/time/file presence/`continue` never triggers blanket hydration.

### Mode rules

1. **IDEATE:** explore and compare; do not edit production code. A material formal outcome routes to DEFINE, while ordinary brainstorming remains chat/optional approved idea placement.
2. **DEFINE:** resolve one change identity; follow current backend dependency order; write only applicable artifacts. `requirements-grilling` owns `interview.md`; `test-document-generator` owns `test-plan.md`. Use the smallest decision-changing question/evidence lookup. Final `test-plan.md` acceptance remains the sole lifecycle-level pre-BUILD user gate, separate from material, validation, permission, and exact operation gates.
3. **BUILD:** require explicit implementation intent and current formal readiness. Derive a dependency-ordered queue from the accepted contract, implement complete scoped packages, and record lightweight savepoints without package approvals or automatic tests/reviews. `BUILD_MATERIAL_DISCOVERY` stops affected work before a change to scope, architecture, dependency, public contract, permission, acceptance, or verification strategy and returns it to DEFINE. Acceptance alone executes nothing.
4. **SHIP:** require fresh explicit closeout intent plus current implementation evidence. Reuse still-covering BUILD evidence; refresh only affected rows. Direct inspection is default; review/repair/packaging/release capabilities run only for the exact closeout gap.

### Verification owner

The active ordinary-task/lifecycle owner chooses the smallest fresh check supporting the exact claim. Specialized skills may suggest risk-specific evidence but cannot impose per-slice full suites, automatic stress tests, review matrices, repeated rechecks, duplicate approvals, or additional completion authority. Broaden only when the affected integration, packaging, browser, permission, installer, security, or release claim requires it. BUILD permits at most one targeted repair/recheck and does not transition automatically to SHIP.

## Continuation and compound intent

- `continue`, `继续`, `go ahead`, and `继续做` resume exactly one active authorized envelope only when target, phase, current gates, and remaining budget are unambiguous. Preserve counters and stop state; never broaden authorization, change phase/target, refresh acceptance, or reset budget. Otherwise ask one decision-shaped question and perform no affected mutation.
- A continuation carrying a material delta returns to DEFINE and never resumes execution. A no-write/chat-only clause overrides formal writeback, continue+delta, and acceptance+BUILD for that turn and yields only a blocked/`Unverified` preview with zero persistence/execution/mutation/acceptance/budget consumption.
- Same-turn acceptance+BUILD persists/classifies acceptance in its owning artifact, rereads affected files once, then validates BUILD gates before execution.
- Combined BUILD+SHIP intent authorizes only current-phase BUILD. Later SHIP requires fresh evidence and new explicit intent.
- Package savepoints contain `scope`, `files_changed`, `unresolved_items`, `evidence_state`, and `next_package`; they trigger no automatic test, review, commit, or package approval.
- Commit, push, merge, and release each require exact action-specific approval. CI failure reports the failed target/commit/tree/check and returns control to the user without automatic repair, commit, push, merge, or release.

## Generated OpenSpec adapter boundary

AILI guarantees only its four routes. Current generated `.opencode` `/opsx-*`, apply/continue/archive, and `openspec-*` adapters remain directly callable outside AILI. Do not route or recommend users to them, hand-edit/wrap/suppress/prevent them, alter their generator for control, or treat direct output as AILI evidence. Later AILI work must establish its own current contract, acceptance, and verification; integration/control is Phase II.

## Boundaries

- Only four top-level delivery commands are valid: `/ideate`, `/define`, `/build`, `/ship`.
- `/local-review` is a standalone non-delivery local audit command owned by `local-review-gate`; do not route it through this delivery lifecycle skill as a fifth lifecycle mode.
- Research, questionnaire, test-plan, implementation, debugging, review, repair, and harness evolution are internal stages, not user command entrypoints.
- Anti-entrypoint blacklist: do not expose or invent top-level `/research`, `/questionnaire`, `/test-plan`, `/implement`, `/debug`, `/review`, `/repair`, `/harness`, or backend-specific lifecycle commands.
- Do not register `/loop`, `/schedule`, `/goal`, `/proactive`, `/cycle`, `/watch`, `/objective`, or any other public lifecycle alias. Treat those words only as semantic classifier input. AILI does not own, imitate, bind, modify, or control native `/goal`; its successful behavior is Stage II / N/A. Automation scope blocks under the lifecycle reference.
- Backend-specific task systems store artifacts; they do not weaken lifecycle gates.
- Explicit acceptance of final `test-plan.md` is the sole mandatory lifecycle-level pre-BUILD user gate. Material-decision, coherence, strict-validation, permission, destructive/high-risk, external-operation, and named-risk gates remain separate and cannot be relabeled lifecycle acceptance.
- A33 routing starts only from the user-selected Git startup host. AILI does not rank, move, broadly scan for, or auto-select hosts; every lane targets one declared repository, target rules may only narrow, same-level conflicts block, and artifacts stay in the owning target. A30 external-read routing is historical only.
- A33 text here and in the references is admission/approval policy only. It creates no worktree operation authority: PREPARE has zero add/remove effect, and every real or `driver_fixture` ADD and later non-force REMOVE needs its own fresh exact key/class-bound approval and separate applicable risk gate.

## Verification

- Confirm the selected mode/ordinary loop and backend when applicable.
- Name the artifact(s) created or updated.
- For BUILD and SHIP, include traceability-backed fresh verification evidence or mark remaining items `Open Question` / `Unverified`.
- For any blocked gate, return the missing approval, artifact, or evidence as the next action.
