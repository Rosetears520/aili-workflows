| Copy/adapt scope | Adapted evidence reconciliation, fail-closed missing-evidence handling, dedupe, and adversarial finding checks; upstream fan-out and phase machinery are not active defaults. |
| Rationale | Selected ECC evidence patterns strengthen direct-first ROSE review without creating automatic lane dispatch or a broader command surface. |

| Copy/adapt scope | Adapted direct invocation, single-persona command, optional independently justified evidence joins, and research isolation; automatic fan-out and Claude-only runtime details are not active. |

## OpenCode / AILI adaptation boundaries

- Do not add public `multi-*` commands, ECC-named commands, or router personas.
- Do not activate external workflow runtimes, Agent Teams, Claude-specific team/tool assumptions, Codex/Gemini runtime dependencies, or `ccg-workflow`.
- ROSE/MainAgent is the only orchestrator and the only final decision owner.
- Personas do not invoke other personas; a worker may return one concrete missing-capability need to ROSE but cannot start a follow-up lane.
- Review, security, convergence, and test-analysis lanes are read-only unless their specific lane contract is a bounded test runner with no source edits.

## Activated AILI behavior

- Direct invocation remains preferred for one perspective on one artifact.
- Single-persona command behavior stays scoped to `/local-review`; it routes target resolution and report state, not a broad router command.
- Direct ROSE review is the default. At most one auxiliary capability may use up to two fresh independent read-only contexts only when a concrete evidence gap and concurrency benefit justify them.
- Each lane packet carries target identity, accepted scope, source artifacts, diff/files, verification evidence, skipped-lane constraints, artifact placement, forbidden remote mutation, expected status vocabulary, and missing-evidence handling.
- Treat a selected auxiliary result that fails, is empty/status-less, lacks anchors, or cannot inspect required context as missing evidence; do not resume it or dispatch an automatic retry.
- Dedupe findings by affected file/artifact, failure mode, and required action; preserve the highest defensible severity.
- Split findings into blocking and advisory buckets: confirmed Critical/Important or unverifiable high-risk findings block; suggestions and refuted findings remain advisory.
- Use adversarial verification for Critical/Important findings: check whether context, tests, types, existing guards, or project rules disprove the finding before blocking.
- When independently justified parallel evidence was actually used, reconcile its compact results before relying on the joined claim; do not add phase checkpoints or lanes merely because work has phases.

## Rejected upstream behavior

- A workflow tool owning approval or publish decisions.
- Raw PR argument shell use.
- Any GitHub comment, review, approve, merge, checkout, clone, push, or API mutation from review mode.
- Replacing `/ideate`, `/define`, `/build`, or `/ship` with ECC multi-agent commands.
