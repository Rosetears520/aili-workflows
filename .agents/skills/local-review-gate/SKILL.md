name: local-review-gate
description: Use for `/local-review` or lifecycle-triggered local review gates over worktree diffs, refs, PRs, or OpenSpec changes; owns target resolution, evidence scope, categorized review reports, verdicts, explicit repair/re-review, and no-remote-mutation boundaries without overriding OpenCode `/review`.

# Local Review Gate

## Purpose

Use this skill when the user invokes `/local-review`, when BUILD or SHIP asks for a local review gate, or when a formal/multi-phase change needs a report-first audit before repair, PR submission, or final lifecycle acceptance.

This skill is the workflow authority for the AILI-owned local review gate. It is not OpenCode's built-in `/review`, it does not replace `/ship`, and it does not make subagent PASS reports final acceptance authority.

## Non-Negotiable Boundaries

- Do not override, replace, or depend on OpenCode's built-in `/review` command.
- Do not claim release-ready, archive-ready, merge-ready, or SHIP-ready status; `/local-review` verdicts apply only to the reviewed target and evidence scope.
- Do not push, create PRs, comment on GitHub, approve/request changes, merge, tag, publish, delete, reset, clean, or mutate remote state.
- PR mode may run only the exact GitHub CLI allowlist `gh pr view`, `gh pr diff`, and `gh pr list --head`; do not run `gh api`, `gh pr checkout`, `gh pr comment`, `gh pr review`, `gh pr merge`, `gh pr create`, `gh repo clone`, or equivalent push, merge, comment, review, checkout, clone, or remote-mutating commands.
- Do not perform repair until after a categorized report exists and `--repair` or an explicit user/current-contract approval authorizes repair.
- Review lanes remain read-only. Approved repair must go to a separate edit/repair agent or edit/test lane, and affected findings require fresh re-review before being marked fixed.
- Do not hide skipped checks, unavailable tools, stale evidence, partial context, or `Unverified` items.

## Upstream Provenance and Adaptation

Before copying or adapting upstream review material, read `references/upstream-provenance.md` and preserve its active/deferred source split. Active behavior references for this gate are:

- `references/ecc-code-review-adaptation.md`: local/PR target selection, full-file review, validation, report artifact, verdict mapping, and read-only PR-mode boundaries.
- `references/review-repair-lane-adaptation.md`: ECC-derived review/repair lane triggers, build-fix loop discipline, and separate repair ownership.
- `references/orchestration-adaptation.md`: fail-closed fan-out/fan-in, blocking/advisory split, adversarial verification, phase checkpoints, and main-agent-only writer/orchestrator rules.
- `references/addyosmani-code-review-rubric.md`: five-axis review rubric, `Critical`/`Important`/`Suggestion`, spec/task-first reading, concrete fixes, and uncertainty/proof gates.
- `references/codex-github-compatibility.md`: behavior-only Codex/GitHub compatibility for AGENTS rules, PR focus instructions, high-priority findings, and local review/fix parity without cloud mutation.
- `references/graphify-local-review.md`: explicit-operation-only Graphify adapter, pinned provenance/security concerns, sole guarded launcher, exact argv/network/environment/output controls, local-uncommitted output, and advisory-only findings. It adds no install, registration, hook/plugin, scheduler, lifecycle gate, or completion authority.

- Active derivative-reference sources: primary ECC `affaan-m/ECC` and `addyosmani/agent-skills`.
- Behavior-only guidance: official Codex review docs; do not copy Codex documentation text.
- Deferred or non-primary candidates: Kodelyth ECC, Elaine mirror/candidate, and `cminn10/ecc2cursor` unless a later scoped provenance review activates them.
- Preserve MIT license/provenance for copied/adapted ECC or addyosmani material, including source URL, source path, copied/adapted scope, and adaptation rationale.
- Replace Claude/ECC-specific tool, path, command, permission, and runtime assumptions with OpenCode/AILI-safe equivalents before activation.
- Keep long copied/adapted material in references where possible, and use precise triggers and near-miss boundaries to avoid over-triggering.
- Do not activate `.claude` paths, Claude-only tools, ECC-only command names, `ccg-workflow`, Codex/Gemini runtime dependencies, public `multi-*` commands, or unsafe remote mutation defaults.

## Target Resolver

Resolve and report the target before dispatching review lanes or accepting findings.

| Input | Required resolution |
|---|---|
| no args | staged, unstaged, and untracked local changes; report absent categories too |
| `--base <branch>` | current branch, selected base, merge-base, diff range, and any local staged/unstaged/untracked overlay |
| `--commit <sha>` | commit identity, parent/range, touched files, and unavailable commit metadata |
| `--pr <url\|number>` | read-only PR metadata/diff only through the exact GitHub CLI allowlist `gh pr view`, `gh pr diff`, and `gh pr list --head` when available; no `gh api`, checkout, clone, comment, review, merge, create, push, or equivalent remote mutation |
| `--change <id\|path>` or OpenSpec path | proposal, design, tasks, specs, interview, test-plan, context, progress, drift log or legacy implementation notes, review report, final diff, and verification evidence |
| `--focus <text>` or adversarial wording | target plus focus lane emphasis such as security, tests, data loss, performance, spec drift, or adversarial review |
| `--repair` | only after a categorized report exists; convert approved findings into scoped repair packages and require re-review |

For OpenSpec `--change <id|path>` targets, resolve the conventional artifact paths directly instead of relying only on broad glob/search output. Local `openspec/` directories may be git-ignored or omitted from snapshot-style indexes, so the target resolver must attempt exact reads or file listings for `proposal.md`, `design.md`, `tasks.md`, `interview.md`, `test-plan.md`, `context.md`, `progress.txt`, `review-report.md`, `drift-log.md`, legacy `implementation-notes.html`, and `specs/**/spec.md` before marking the artifact absent. If a broad search finds no OpenSpec files but exact reads/listing show the change exists, treat the broad search as insufficient evidence rather than as absence.

If target, base, PR identity, OpenSpec change id, report path, permission, or required evidence source is ambiguous and cannot be safely inferred, return `BLOCKED` with the exact missing decision.

## Full-Context Evidence Policy

Diff-only review is insufficient for high-confidence findings.

Before reporting a definite critical, security, data-loss, compatibility, correctness, or test adequacy finding, require:

- full inspection of changed files and relevant untracked files;
- related tests, fixtures, config, docs, AGENTS files, manifests, schemas, or protocol docs that constrain behavior;
- callers, consumers, peer patterns, or downstream output paths when the claim depends on integration behavior;
- command or artifact evidence for verification claims, or an explicit skipped reason with risk.

When full context cannot be inspected within scope, label the affected claim `Unverified`, downgrade confidence, and prevent a `PASS` verdict unless the item is immaterial or explicitly accepted as risk.

## Report Artifact Contract

For non-trivial targets, create or update a repository-local Markdown report before repair starts.

- OpenSpec default: `openspec/changes/<change-id>/review-report.md`.
- Non-OpenSpec target: ask once for a repository-local report path, or offer chat-only review only when the user explicitly accepts the persistence limitation as `Unverified`.
- Do not store or print secrets, tokens, private keys, cookies, raw logs, full transcripts, full file dumps, or private data in reports; use redacted path:line/type evidence instead.

The report must record:

- target, base/ref, merge-base, commit, PR metadata, or change id;
- timestamp and current worktree/dirty-path classification when relevant;
- source artifacts reviewed and source artifacts missing;
- files/artifacts inspected in full, sampled, or skipped;
- review lanes and checks run, skipped, stale, or unavailable;
- categorized findings with severity, category, source lane, evidence anchor, affected file/artifact, required action, repair owner, repairability, current status, and re-review requirement;
- previous findings, resolved/deferred/accepted-risk/out-of-scope items, and re-review history;
- final verdict and named residual `Unverified` items.

All review/test/security/coverage/convergence lane results embedded or referenced by the report must use the shared finding/result envelope in `aili-delivery-flow/references/protocols/subagent-result.md`. A worker proposes `fix`, `refute-with-counter-evidence`, `accept-named-risk`, or `Unverified-block`; ROSE owns final disposition. Do not reconcile by majority vote, lane count, or averaged confidence, and do not treat a worker verdict as final authority.

### Conditional arbitration artifact

- Create or update exactly `openspec/changes/<change-id>/review-arbitration.md` only when a finding is disputed, blocking, cross-session, or materially inconsistent.
- Preserve stable finding ID, competing claims, evidence and counter-evidence, proposed dispositions, ROSE disposition and rationale, decision owner, status, required recheck, freshness, and residual `Unverified` items.
- A credible material minority finding stays open until fixed/rechecked, refuted with counter-evidence, accepted as a named risk by the authorized owner, or blocked as `Unverified`.
- Do not create the artifact for routine uncontested findings and do not pre-create an empty instance.

## Verdict Vocabulary

Use only these local-review verdicts:

- `BLOCKED`: target, permissions, evidence, report placement, or required decision is missing.
- `NEEDS_FIXES`: actionable blocking or important findings remain.
- `NEEDS_REVIEW`: human/product decision or conflicting evidence is required.
- `PASS_WITH_UNVERIFIED`: no blocking findings remain, but named skipped or unverifiable items remain.
- `PASS`: no blocking findings for the audited target and evidence scope, with fresh evidence and no material `Unverified` items.
- `REPAIRING`: approved repair packages are being executed by separate edit/repair or edit/test lanes.
- `REREVIEW_REQUIRED`: fixes were made or prior findings remain unresolved and need fresh review.

`PASS` never means release-ready or SHIP-ready.

For large or harness-sensitive `/local-review --change <id|path>` targets, `NEEDS_FIXES` and `BLOCKED` block BUILD continuation. `PASS_WITH_UNVERIFIED` may continue only after the user accepts each named `Unverified` item; otherwise return `NEEDS_REVIEW` or `BLOCKED` with the missing acceptance.

## Lane Selection

Select relevant lanes; do not run every lane by default.

- target/context lane: target identity, diff/base/PR/change scope, dirty paths, and report placement;
- `code-reviewer`: correctness, maintainability, architecture, performance, and context adequacy;
- `test-engineer` or `test-coverage-reviewer`: verification story, test quality, and uncovered paths;
- `security-auditor`: auth, permissions, secrets, shell/installers, network, dependencies, storage, or data-loss risk;
- `pr-test-analyzer`: branch/PR-like diffs, changed-test review, CI-log interpretation, and focused command matrix;
- `ai-regression-scout`: prompts, agents, skills, routing, fixtures, model/tool routing, or generated-output changes;
- `silent-failure-reviewer`: stale evidence, skipped gates, misleading reports, swallowed errors, and false PASS risk;
- `convergence-reviewer`: formal OpenSpec, multi-phase, harness-sensitive, or evidence-heavy work where source artifacts must be compared to tasks, diff, progress, review, and verification evidence;
- browser/E2E lanes only when the changed surface and artifact placement justify them;
- open-source/provenance lanes only when public/package/provenance exposure is in scope.

Each lane packet must include target identity, accepted scope, source artifacts, diff/files, evidence already run, artifact placement rules, forbidden remote mutation, skipped-lane constraints, and expected return status. Review lanes are read-only and must not repair their own findings.

Apply the adapted upstream lane gates:

- run `code-reviewer` with five axes: correctness, readability, architecture, security, and performance;
- require spec/task-first and tests-first review where those artifacts exist;
- require `Critical`/`Important` findings to include exact evidence, concrete failure mode, why existing guards do not catch it, and a concrete fix;
- accept zero findings only when inspected scope, skipped checks, and confidence are recorded;
- fail closed when a required lane cannot run, returns empty/status-less output, or lacks evidence anchors;
- split reconciled findings into blocking and advisory buckets, with unverifiable high-risk findings blocking until checked or explicitly accepted.

## Convergence and Phase Checkpoints

For formal or multi-phase work, include convergence review and phase checkpoint evidence:

- serial phase packets declare a checkpoint: command, static check, artifact inspection, diff inspection, or skipped reason with risk;
- after each serial phase, ROSE runs or delegates the checkpoint before the next dependent phase continues;
- parallel lanes declare join evidence, and ROSE reconciles each lane's status, evidence, conflicts, blockers, skipped checks, and missing evidence;
- the join point runs verification over the merged output before later phases continue;
- final local review compares source artifacts, phase evidence, final diff/worktree state, review findings, and verification evidence.

For a Package 12 formal final gate, all specialist lanes are independently dispatched by ROSE with explicit `edit: deny` and `task: deny` in the final-review overlay, including `test-engineer`, and return directly to ROSE. ROSE joins every expected lane without voting. The existing `convergence-reviewer` alone owns checklist completeness; `plan-auditor` is pre-implementation and `silent-failure-reviewer` is complementary.

Packages 1–11 record lightweight savepoints containing complete behavior scope, files changed, unresolved items, and next package. Optional commands or diff feedback are not package closure or independent quality gates. Package 12 alone runs the mandatory canonical matrix and holistic convergence.

## Anti-Pseudo-Completion Checks

Reject pseudo-completion when:

- prior findings are unresolved or not explicitly accepted/out-of-scope;
- verification output is stale, missing, partial, or not tied to the exact reviewed target;
- a lane reports success without anchors, inspected scope, lane status, and skipped-check reasons;
- tasks, specs, test-plan items, or accepted requirements lack implementation/evidence coverage;
- dirty paths are unknown or unrelated to the claimed scope;
- skipped checks lack a reason and risk;
- the report claims to replace PR review without target/base metadata, inspected files, checks, findings, and re-review evidence.

## Repair and Re-Review Loop

1. Resolve target and write/update the categorized report.
2. Classify findings before repair.
3. If repair is authorized, convert repairable findings into scoped BUILD-style packages.
4. Assign fixes to a separate edit/repair agent or edit/test lane; review lanes remain read-only.
5. For build/type failures, detect the build system, group errors by file/root cause, fix one error class at a time, rerun focused verification, and stop if the same error persists after three attempts, more errors are introduced than fixed, a dependency/lockfile change is needed, or the fix requires architecture changes.
6. Run affected verification after repair.
7. Re-run only the relevant review lanes with fresh target identity, diff, evidence, and prior-finding state.
8. Keep verdict `REREVIEW_REQUIRED` until affected findings are rechecked.
