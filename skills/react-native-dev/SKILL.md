# React Native & Expo Development Guide

A practical guide for building production-ready React Native and Expo applications. Covers UI, animations, state, testing, performance, and deployment.

## Routing Boundary

Use this skill for React Native or Expo mobile apps, Expo Router, native mobile components, mobile permissions, EAS, and App Store/Play Store release work. Use `frontend-ui-engineering` or `frontend-dev` for browser React/web UI, `android-native-dev` for Kotlin/Compose Android, `ios-application-dev` for Swift/UIKit/SwiftUI iOS, and `flutter-dev` for Flutter/Dart.

## Quick Reference

### Implementation Workflow

1. **Inspect runtime mode**: determine Expo managed, Expo prebuild/dev client, or bare React Native; record SDK/RN versions, router, state libraries, native modules, and nearest tests.
2. **Choose the path** with the Expo/RN decision table; keep the existing runtime mode unless the task explicitly requires migration.
3. **Implement the smallest slice**: route/screen shell, state/data layer, native capability permission path, loading/error/empty states, then release configuration only if requested.
4. **Verify in layers**: run targeted Jest/RNTL tests, TypeScript/lint if present, `npx expo start` or platform build only when native/runtime behavior changed.
5. **Report evidence**: list emulator/device/runtime mode, command results, and any store/EAS checks left `Unverified`.

🔴 CHECKPOINT · 🛑 STOP before ejecting/prebuilding, adding a native module, changing EAS profiles, modifying store metadata, or replacing navigation/state architecture. These require explicit approval.

### Expo / React Native Decision Flow

| Project state or need | Use | Do not use |
|---|---|---|
| New app or Expo managed app | Expo Router + Expo SDK modules | Bare RN setup without explicit reason |
| Existing bare RN app | Existing React Navigation/native module setup | Migrating to Expo during a feature fix |
| Native API available in Expo Go | Expo module and permission hooks | Custom native module |
| Native API not available in Expo Go | Dev client/prebuild only after approval | Silent `expo prebuild` |
| Long list/image-heavy UI | `FlashList`, `expo-image`, memoized rows | `FlatList`/RN `Image` for large feeds |
| Shared server state | React Query | Global Zustand store for fetched cache |

### Failure Modes and Fallbacks

| Trigger | First response | If still failing |
|---|---|---|
| `npm/yarn/pnpm install` dependency conflict | Identify package manager and lockfile; keep existing versions and Expo SDK compatibility | Report conflict; do not force install or upgrade SDK unasked |
| Expo SDK/native module mismatch | Check `npx expo doctor` or package peer requirements when available | Stop before prebuild/eject or dependency changes |
| Metro cache/runtime error | Restart Metro with project-approved cache command if documented | Report exact error and avoid deleting broad local state |
| Jest/RNTL fails after UI change | Mock only native modules required by the changed component, following nearby tests | Mark test blocker if native module cannot be mocked locally |
| EAS build fails | Separate code/signing/profile errors; inspect the failing phase | Do not change credentials, profiles, or store config without approval |
| Release/test lane unavailable | Provide manual runbook and mark release evidence `Unverified` | Do not claim app-store readiness |

### Do Not Do This

- Do not run `expo prebuild`, eject, or add native modules as an unapproved shortcut.
- Do not use `--force`, `--legacy-peer-deps`, or broad dependency upgrades to bypass conflicts.
- Do not mutate EAS credentials, signing, bundle IDs, package names, or store metadata unless assigned.
- Do not use browser React patterns that ignore native safe areas, gestures, keyboard avoidance, or accessibility roles.
- Do not claim performance improvement without profiler, frame, bundle, or before/after evidence.

### Component Preferences

| Purpose | Use | Instead of |
|---------|-----|------------|
| Lists | `FlashList` (`@shopify/flash-list`) + `memo` items | `FlatList` (no view recycling) |
| Images | `expo-image` | RN `<Image>` (no cache, no WebP) |
| Press | `Pressable` | `TouchableOpacity` (legacy) |
| Audio | `expo-audio` | `expo-av` (deprecated) |
| Video | `expo-video` | `expo-av` (deprecated) |
| Animations | Reanimated 3 | RN Animated API (limited) |
| Gestures | Gesture Handler | PanResponder (legacy) |
| Platform check | `process.env.EXPO_OS` | `Platform.OS` |
| Context | `React.use()` | `React.useContext()` (React 18) |
| Safe area scroll | `contentInsetAdjustmentBehavior="automatic"` | `<SafeAreaView>` |
| SF Symbols | `expo-image` with `source="sf:name"` | `expo-symbols` |

### Scaling Up

| Situation | Consider |
|-----------|----------|
| Long lists with scroll jank | Virtualized list libraries (e.g. FlashList) |
| Want Tailwind-style classes | NativeWind v4 |
| High-frequency storage reads | Sync-based storage (e.g. MMKV) |
| New project with Expo | Expo Router over bare React Navigation |

### State Management

| State Type | Solution |
|------------|----------|
| Local UI state | `useState` / `useReducer` |
| Shared app state | Zustand or Jotai |
| Server / async data | React Query |
| Form state | React Hook Form + Zod |

### Performance Priorities

| Priority | Issue | Fix |
|----------|-------|-----|
| CRITICAL | Long list jank | `FlashList` + memoized items |
| CRITICAL | Large bundle | Avoid barrel imports, enable R8 |
| HIGH | Too many re-renders | Zustand selectors, React Compiler |
| HIGH | Slow startup | Disable bundle compression, native nav |
| MEDIUM | Animation drops | Only animate `transform`/`opacity` |

## New Project Init

```bash
# 1. Create project
npx create-expo-app@latest my-app --template blank-typescript
cd my-app

# 2. Install Expo Router + core deps
npx expo install expo-router react-native-safe-area-context react-native-screens

# 3. (Optional) Common extras
npx expo install expo-image react-native-reanimated react-native-gesture-handler
```

Then configure:

1. Set entry point in `package.json`: `"main": "expo-router/entry"`
2. Add scheme in `app.json`: `"scheme": "my-app"`
3. Delete `App.tsx` and `index.ts`
4. Create `app/_layout.tsx` as root Stack layout
5. Create `app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx` for tab navigation
6. Create route files in `app/(tabs)/` (see [navigation.md](references/navigation.md))

For web support, also install: `npx expo install react-native-web react-dom @expo/metro-runtime`

## Core Principles

**Consult references before writing**: when implementing navigation, lists, networking, or project setup, read the matching reference file above for patterns and pitfalls.

**Try Expo Go first** (`npx expo start`). Custom builds (`eas build`) only needed when using local Expo modules, Apple targets, or third-party native modules not in Expo Go.

**Conditional rendering**: use `{count > 0 && <Text />}` not `{count && <Text />}` (renders "0").

**Animation rule**: only animate `transform` and `opacity` — GPU-composited, no layout thrash.

**Imports**: always import directly from source, not barrel files — avoids bundle bloat.

**Lists and images**: before using `FlatList` or RN `Image`, check the Component Preferences table above — `FlashList` and `expo-image` are almost always the right choice.

**Route files**: always use kebab-case, never co-locate components/types/utils in `app/`.

## Checklist
